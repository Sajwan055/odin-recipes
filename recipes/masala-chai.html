<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li><strong>Tea:</strong></li>
<p>There are different types of tea which we can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assam tea:</strong>It is loved for it's deep colour and strong flavour.</li>
<li><strong>Darjeeling tea:</strong>It is well known for fruity flavour.</li>
<li><strong>Nilgiri tea:</strong>It has fruity flavour of Darjeeling tea and strong flavour Assam tea.</li>

</ul>
<li><strong>Spices:</strong>Common spices used are green cardmoms,cloves and cinnamon &amp; Optional spices are black pepper,ginger,fennel seeds,nutmeg and star anise.</li>
<li><strong>Milk:</strong>Ideally ratio of water to milk can range from 1:1 to 3:1 depending on kind of milk.</li>
<li><strong>Sweetner:</strong>Traditionally unrefined sweetner known as jaggery is used.It is personal choice you can use refine sugar too.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make Black Tea</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Pour 1&frac12; cup water to a pot.Add tea powder or tea leaves.Chai made on low flame taste best.</li>
<li>Bring this to boil &amp; simmer. Meanwhile get your spices ready.</li>

</ul>
<li><strong>Spices for masala tea</strong></li>
<ul>
<p><li>To make instant masala chai,add the following whole spices to spice grinder:</li></p>
<li> 1 to 2 cloves</li>
<li>&frac12;to &frac34; cinnamon</li>
<li>4 green cardamoms</li>
</ul>
<li>Crush them fine or slightly coarse to bring out the flavours.</li>
<li>Add sugar at this stage according to taste.</li>
<li>Pour &frac12; cup full fat milk to the simmering black tea.Adjust the quantity of milk as needed.Adding milk before boiling the ginger well will more likely curdle the milk.So ensure you add the milk only after boiling the ginger well with black tea.</li>
<li>Boil on a low to medium heat until the tea turns dark.Simmering helps the tea to thicken.But simmer again for little longer so the tea doesn't have the milk flavour.</li>
<li>Filter masala chai tea to serving cups.</li>
<li>Serve delicious <strong>Masala Tea</strong> with snacks like biscuit etc.</li>
